                      <p id="story_continues_1">Naked Rambler Stephen Gough has walked free from prison after spending 657 days locked up.</p>
        <p>The 53-year-old said he was looking forward to seeing his children for the first time in years.</p>
        <p>A naked Mr Gough was spoken to by police as he was freed from Perth Prison, but was allowed to go on his way in an apparent shift in policy from Tayside Police.</p>
        <p>On his last release, officers arrested the former marine within 60 seconds.</p>
        <p>Mr Gough earned the title Naked Rambler by walking unclothed from Lands End to John O'Groats after quitting his job as a lorry driver.</p>
  <span>Different approach</span>
	      <p>He has been repeatedly arrested in the street outside Perth Prison by police waiting for him to be released at the end of each sentence.</p>
        <p>The former marine welcomed the new police response: "My opinion is that the police have thought 'the guy's not going to give up so let's have a think about it'.</p>
        <p>"Something has changed and it is good news for me. </p>
        <p>"What they were doing before was pre-empting complaints and now they are not."</p>
        <p>Mr Gough said he now plans to head south and hoped to see his children.</p>
  <span>Still naked</span>
	      <p>"I haven't seen my kids for ages," he said and added that he would like to visit his mother, whom he hasn't seen in six years.</p>
        <p>However, the 53-year-old has no intention of changing his ways.</p>
        <p>He said: "To conform with everyone else is the easiest way but when you conform you compromise your principles.</p>
        <p>"I am not going to give up. Stay naked is the word."</p>
        <p>Mr Gough has spent the majority of the last decade behind bars due to his determination to live his life without clothes.</p>
        <p>He has previously claimed arresting him for walking around naked was a breach of his human rights and his right to freedom of expression.</p>
        <p>Tayside Police said they had a duty to uphold the law but it also a responsibility to act in the public interest.</p>
        <p>Ch Insp Andy McCann said: "We have been working closely with our partners in law enforcement and the individual concerned in an effort to resolve this impasse. </p>
        <p>"We hope that by exercising some discretion we can find a more satisfactory conclusion for all concerned."</p>
