## Helpful things to get:

* [ES GUI](https://github.com/mobz/elasticsearch-head)

## Info

1. Insert some sample data by running es-insert.js in the database folder

2. Check out the functions in test.js to get an idea. 
 * I commented out all the functions cause running them async will screwed things up
 * Recommend running one function at a time...
